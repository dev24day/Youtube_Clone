After 'get' request -> should be 'respond' request
respond can be done by HTML, console, error, ...
otherwise, loading forever..

babel => Compiler for JS
new gen. fancy sexy language(syntax?)

It's about the connection until it finish ..?
Step1. How the connection starts => the moment we go to browser(requested)
Step2. After connected => execute the file "index.js"
Step2.n. MiddleWWWWWWWWWWwwWares
Step3. Ex) app.get("/",handlePlus) => respond(final) by function handlePlus : 

app.get(request=route, Middleware, respond) // route를 처리하는 과정
Start <<<<< MiddleWares <<<<<< end
Every kind of function on express can be MiddleWares
Middleware func has 'next' argument

Ex in use>> Confirmation of user id, IP address

Conclusion>> Executing couple of functions beforeeee handling route
